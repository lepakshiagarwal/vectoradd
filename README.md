# vectoradd
Using acc data to accelerate the vector addition
The vector addition sample (vector_add_serial.c) adds two vectors A and B to produce C, where Ci = Ai + Bi. In this particular case the vectors A and B are filled with trigonometric data and summed. Results are  comparsion of execution time between serial and acc version.
